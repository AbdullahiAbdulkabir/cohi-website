Muslim association. They are organ&#39;s of Mssn Yabatech with the same focus. They help in fulfilling
some of the objectives.

Not only this, there are lot of programmes which have been put in place to help achieve our
objectives. Starting from the orientation week for the freshers, weekly scholars in the house and
monthly open air lectures, fajr bayan, madrasah and tahfeedh classes, Fiqh classes, Dawah camp
which comes up after first semester examination, the jihad week named I.P.W (Islamic Propagation
Week) and it ends with the annual conference which is aimed at nominating the new executives for
the next adminstration. We&#39;re not left alone in this cause, but rather supported by our Fathers at the Yabatech Muslim
Community, which is chaired by our former Deputy Rector, Dr Ma&#39;ruf Adebakin and the Chief Imam
