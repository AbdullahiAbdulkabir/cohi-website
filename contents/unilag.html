				<p>
					The history of Muslim Students&#39; Society of Nigeria, University of Lagos Branch has been vibrant in the
aspect of Islamic propagation. Its activities have not only transformed lives of Muslims on campus but
also touched positively many souls outside the campus. Since inception, the Society has undergone
tremendous positive changes vis-Ã -vis Islamic reawakening, human developments and societal
cohesiveness. It is this leading role that MSSN UNILAG has continuously played that has earned her the
leading position she currently occupies.</p>
