				<p>The society, Muslim Students' Society of Nigeria, is the meeting point for all Muslim 
					Students in all Higher Institutions, Secondary Schools in most part (if not all), 
					graduate and Post Graduates as well as Muslims who attend technical institution, 
					like the craftsmen and women in Nigeria. Frankly speaking, this society has one of the 
					largest spread of society in (religious or otherwise) in the whole of Nigeria.

					privileged to attend any school in the country, secondary or tertiary, to be conscious

			<h3>FROM THE CORDINATOR</h3>
				<strong>- AbdulBasit AbdusSalam</strong>
				<p>
					All gratitude and adulations are due to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the world. 
					Blessings and mercies upon the noble soul of prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), his household, his 
					companions and all of us who tread the path of truth and peace. 
					it is with tremendous pleasure that I welcome you to the website. It is hoped that on this 
					website, you feel more connected to the Council and get the latest updates about it. Over 
					the years, the need to have a website where you, our esteemed member, can better reach out 
					to us and feel in our world has been birthed in us. AlhamduliLlah, you reading this shows 
					the realisation of the dream. 
					The Council of Higher Institutions (C.O.H.I.) is an organ of the Muslim Students’ Society of 
					Nigeria (M.S.S.N.). C.O.H.I is charged with the responsibility of coordinating the affairs 
					of students, and has over the years served as a bridge between members and the Students’ 
					society. With 21 affiliates, the Council has successfully entrenched herself as a core organ 
					for students’ development. 
					As an organ primarily concerned with the growth of members, the council provides frequent 
					platforms to keep members engaged intellectually. The Capacity Building Course (C.B.C.), one 
					of such platforms aims at equipping members with basic tools for surviving in the age we find 
					ourselves. 
					The Campus Interactive Forum (C.I.F.), another major event organised has been a meeting point 
					for students across various tertiary institutions to exchange opinions and discuss major issues 
					affecting the youth, country and the world at large.
					These and many other programmes have helped to create an understanding among members from 
					different institutions and also sow the seed of oneness in them.

					The council has a driving push. To engender a society where Muslims are at the frontline, doing 
					well and keeping the flag of Islam high. With the current administration’s mottobeing “Inclusiveness
					 and Dynamism,” the council hopes to help YOU actualise your potentials and expand your network.
